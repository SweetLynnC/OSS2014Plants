## Introduction

This is the practice markdown for the plant group.



```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  comment = "#>",
  error = FALSE,
  echo = FALSE,
  tidy = FALSE
)

# If we change echo=TRUE then it will print the code in the pdf.
```


```{r ChunkName}
x <- rnorm(5)
x
```
* We can cache the code so that each time we run the .Rmd file Rscript will only run code where changes have been made.

We can have text and r code in this document.



```{r PlotExample}
plot(cars)
```
