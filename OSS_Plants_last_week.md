##Goals for OSS final week

Get small subset of data and run JSDM so everyone is on the same page with how they work
	Target – just trees, handful of species (10?) with fewer iterations

Extract plot data by extent and remove projects we’re not including (e.g. VTM)

Get environmental data attribute to plot codes

Get species data attributed to plot codes

Climate WNA to attribute point data (do we want 30 yr normals)
	Climatic water deficit
	Seasonal means

Soil data – need to complete download and select attributes to use

Assess computing requirements and make arrangements to use server

Set up markdown document for manuscript

Discuss pseudoreplication with Ben Bolker


----------


__Rough Schedule__
- Monday – brainstorm until 3:30 to 4pm to plan for the rest of the week, then pull together first model run
- Tuesday – finish first model run and discuss/review runs (do we have trait data to incorporate on Wed or Thurs?)
- Wednesday – continue to build in additional components of the model, review markdown file
- Wed-Friday – think about coding testing model fit (AUC, etc.), discuss goals after leaving NCEAS, collaboration and authorship documents
