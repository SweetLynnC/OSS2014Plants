#Notes on Group Presentation on Friday Aug. 1

Construct distance matrix to address pseudoreplication issue
    - PERMANOVA?
	- Multi-level models or hierarchical models to address the issue?
	- With climate layer
	- Figure out what other environment layers we want in think, pair, share, and then decide what we’re going to use


Include phylogenetic distance? 
	- Mark Cadotte used it as a surrogate for trait assemblages

Can we share climate data with drought group?
	- How to apply climate data? Averages? Max/Min?

Can we include management/ownership which may influence species distribution or stand composition?
	- Timber harvest preferentially selects for commercially valuable trees and can influence distributions
	- PCT vs. timber sale
	- Fire Return interval departures – role of fire suppression in forest composition?     - More recent impacts of fire/fuels mgmt, rx burning, and wildland fire use (NPS)

Smithsonian CTFS plots – do those cover our area??
    - Answer = no (only Yosemite starting in 2009).
